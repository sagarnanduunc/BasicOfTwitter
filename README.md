#Analysis Done:
*	The top n users who have tweeted the most related to the search string for the entire timeline 
*	The top n users who have tweeted the most for every hour
*	The top n users who have the maximum followers
*	The top n tweets which have the maximum retweet count

#Collecting Tweets
Tweepy is python library for accessing Twitter API. First part of the code is used to set all the credentials necessary to access data from Twitter’s public API. It then goes on to taking input from the user:
*	string to filter tweets 
*	time period for which tweets are needed.

One thing to note is Twitter public API will give tweets only from last 21 days. So giving random dates as inputs should technically should not return data but can’t comment about how tweepy cursor is defined or if it might have some special permissions.
Final part of the code gets tweets with filter criteria provided and takes only the user’s screen_name, time of tweet, text, users follower count, and tweets retweet count till current time and stores everything in a file with name your SearchString.txt

This code can be used for many different purposes. By changing the filter parameters, you get the way you want your filter query to collect tweets.

##For example:
'''
 #Find statuses that match our interests
            self.log.debug("Strategy set to FOLLOW or TWEET")
            n = hits_per_query
            search_dict = dict()
            search_dict['lang'] = "en"
            if not geocode is None:
                search_dict['geocode'] = geocode
            statuses = list()
            self.log.debug("Queries:")
            for q in queries:
                search_dict['q'] = q
                results = [c for c in Cursor(api.search, **search_dict).items(n)]
'''

#How to get my code running?
*	Place the data file (‘dota.txt’) in the same directory as snandu1.py (Analysis file)
*	I work on Jupyter notebooks. So, output for command prompt will first reqire you to run a command: chcp 65001 (ON WINDOWS)
**	Since twitter has Unicode characters and command prompt is not equipped to print that
*	Then just run the file and you should get the output on command prompt
*	Also, output is stored as csv files with ‘|’ as a separator. You will get all those files in the same folder. You will manually need to convert all those files
